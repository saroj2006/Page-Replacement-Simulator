Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

Overview
This project simulates three common page replacement algorithms used in operating systems:
FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
LRU (Least Recently Used)
Optimal Page Replacement

It allows users to input a sequence of pages and analyze how different algorithms handle page faults based on a fixed number of memory frames.

Features
->FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm
->LRU Page Replacement Algorithm
->Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm
->Tracks and displays page faults
->Simple command-line interface for easy use

How to Run
1. Compile the C++ file:
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o simulator
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./simulator
   ```
3. Provide input:
   - Enter the number of memory frames
   - Enter number of pages
   - Enter the sequence of page requests
     
5. View the results:
   - The program will display the number of page faults for each algorithm

Example:
   Enter number of frames: 3
   Enter number of pages: 10
   Enter page sequence: 7 0 1 2 0 3 4 2 3 0

Sample Output:
   FIFO Page Faults: 7
   LRU Page Faults: 6
   Optimal Page Faults: 5
