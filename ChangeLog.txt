Change Log - Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

[Version 1] - Initial Setup (Basic Structure)
- Created the base project structure.
- Designed input handling for frames and page sequences.

[Version 2] - Implemented FIFO Algorithm
- Added First-In-First-Out (FIFO) page replacement logic.
- Integrated page fault counting.

[Version 3] - Implemented LRU Algorithm
- Developed Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.
- Optimized recent usage tracking for page replacement.

[Version 4] - Implemented Optimal Algorithm
- Added Optimal page replacement logic.
- Used future page reference tracking for better decisions.

[Final Version] - Optimized & Documented Code
- Combined all three algorithms into a single program.
- Implemented a menu-based selection for user interaction.
- Improved efficiency and removed redundant operations.
- Fully documented the code and created a structured README.
